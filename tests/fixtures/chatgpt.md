Below is a practical, data‑driven title bank you can deploy across YouTube and podcast apps, plus a concise rationale for *why* these will rank better for search and voice/AI assistants.

---

## What your content signals today (quick read)

* **Show positioning:** Hospitality‑centric interviews hosted by David “DeLo” DeLorenzo; recent episodes feature Arizona restaurant and bar operators, builders, and compliance experts. ([Apple Podcasts][1])
* **Episode mix:** Local operator stories (Aunt Chilada’s, Toasted Owl), operations/build‑outs, marketing for 2025, and Arizona liquor‑law compliance. ([Apple Podcasts][1])
* **Business objective:** Bar & Restaurant Insurance specializes in hospitality coverage in Arizona; social bios claim 400+ restaurants insured. ([LinkedIn][2])

**Implication:** Lean hard into *Arizona + hospitality + owner intent* and the specific risk/coverage terms your site and guests already surface (liquor license, liquor liability, assault & battery, workers’ comp, cyber for POS, build‑out risks). This aligns the podcast’s discovery with the insurance funnel while staying true to the show’s DNA. (Your blog topics reinforce these terms.) ([Bar Insurance Experts][3])

---

## Show‑level naming (safe for Apple/Spotify + stronger discovery)

Apple and Spotify advise clarity and natural language over keyword stuffing; use a descriptive **subtitle** (not a stuffed main title) so you stay compliant and readable. ([Apple Podcasts][4])

Use one of these structures:

1. **On the DELO** — *Arizona Restaurant & Bar Owners*
2. **On the DELO** — *Arizona Hospitality Stories for Restaurant Owners*
3. **On the DELO** — *Arizona Restaurant Owners on Growth & Risk*
4. **On the DELO** — *Arizona Bars, Restaurants & Hospitality Builders*
5. **On the DELO** — *Restaurant & Bar Insights from Arizona*
6. **On the DELO** — *Arizona Hospitality Operators & Insurance Insights*
7. **On the DELO** — *Phoenix–Scottsdale–Tucson Restaurant Owners*
8. **On the DELO** — *Arizona Liquor License, Liability & Owner Stories*
9. **On the DELO** — *Restaurant Operations, Law & Insurance in Arizona*
10. **On the DELO** — *Arizona Bar & Restaurant Playbooks*

> Why a subtitle? Apple lets you update metadata anytime and favors clear, descriptive fields; a subtitle concentrates regional/industry terms without tripping spam filters. ([Apple Podcasts][4])

## Playlist architecture (YouTube)

YouTube rewards front‑loaded keywords that match viewer intent; titles/descriptions should surface 1–2 primary terms (e.g., *Arizona liquor license*, *bar insurance*). Keep titles honest and non‑clickbaity. ([Google Help][5])

* **Arizona Liquor License & Compliance**
* **Arizona Restaurant & Bar Insurance 101**
* **Phoenix / Scottsdale / Tucson Owner Stories**
* **Build‑Outs, Design & Safety (AZ)**
* **Hospitality Marketing & Tech (AZ)**
* **Claims, Coverage & Risk Mitigation (AZ)**

---

## Title system (how to write every episode going forward)

**Formula:** `Intent + Core Topic + Arizona/City + Owner Persona (+ Year when relevant)`
Examples: *How to Cut Liquor Liability Claims in Arizona (Bar Owners, 2025)*; *Arizona Liquor License: Costs, Timelines & Mistakes (Restaurant Owners Guide)*

* Front‑load “Arizona/City” when geo‑targeting.
* Prefer “How to…”, “What is…”, “Costs…”, “Checklist…”, “Guide…” for voice/AI queries.
* Keep YouTube titles ≲60–65 chars; use longer, descriptive podcast titles. (YouTube/Spotify both emphasize concise, keyword‑rich titles and early description text.) ([Google Help][5])

## Implementation notes (to make these titles work harder)

* **Match metadata to intent.** In YouTube descriptions, repeat your primary phrase in the first 150–120 characters (*e.g., “Arizona liquor license costs…”*) and naturally include 2–3 related terms; avoid stuffing. ([Google Help][5])
* **Episode descriptions:** Spotify recommends concise, keyword‑aware copy that connects to the title within the first 120 characters. ([Spotify for Creators][6])
* **Avoid spammy metadata.** Apple warns against manipulative metadata and favors clear, human‑readable fields; use a subtitle rather than cramming the main title. ([Apple Podcasts][7])
* **Consistency:** Mirror your terminology across site articles (liquor license, liquor liability, assault & battery, workers’ comp), show notes, and YouTube descriptions to reinforce topical authority. Your blog already uses these phrases. ([Bar Insurance Experts][3])

---

## Why this will lift discoverability

* **Search alignment:** Titles map to *high‑intent local queries* (Arizona + [license / insurance / costs / requirements / city]), which AI assistants and search surfaces increasingly favor.
* **Platform compliance:** Uses descriptive, front‑loaded language and avoids keyword stuffing, as recommended by Apple, Spotify and YouTube help docs. ([Apple Podcasts][4])
* **Business fit:** Keeps your hospitality storytelling while routing qualified owners into your risk/coverage expertise—exactly the terms your brand already ranks or posts about. ([LinkedIn][2])

---

**Next step worth doing:** Pick one show subtitle, carve out 4–6 YouTube playlists from the architecture above, and retitle the last 20 episodes using this system (carry the same terms into the first sentence of each description). I can also provide a 1‑page template for descriptions and pinned comments that aligns with these titles and keeps everything consistent across platforms.
